Currently learning Spring Security and i decided to make this repo so my understanding phase will be easy to digest.

Authetication is Who you are in the app like ROLES.

Authorization is what you are allowed to do in the app like PERMISSION.

They are various form to handle security in spring
JWT is actully the safest way to transmit Data btw two parties (they do have Header, Payload and Signature)

Form Authentication present custom html page whic collect credentials and process it those details before givin a value in return (Login Page directing to a Home Page)

HTTP Basic is the process for browsers to request for a Username and Password when autheticating a user

HTTP plus SSL security layout on top of it. HTTPS is the process by which data are delivered securely between endpoints.
